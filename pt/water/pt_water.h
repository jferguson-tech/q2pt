A shallow water simulation for one flat body of liquid, and the pictures
a renderer needs from it: where the surface stands and which way it tilts,
how sharply it curves, which is what gathers light on whatever lies below
(caustics), how far up its banks it has wetted, and where the waves have
beaten the surface to froth.

Each cell of a grid holds how high the surface stands and how fast the
liquid flows across to its neighbours. Waves travel as fast as the depth
under them lets them, so they slow, bunch up and turn over a shallow bed,
pass round whatever stands in the liquid, and slosh between its banks.

It knows nothing about any renderer. The host says where there is liquid
and how deep, steps it, pokes it where things touch the surface, and hands
the pictures on as textures.

waves: R and G are the slopes in x and y, B and A the height.
caustics: R and G are how sharply the surface curves along x and along y,
as in the wave picture made last and times `strength`. Light going
straight down through the surface and d further is brighter by
1 / |(1 + k d R)(1 + k d G)|, k being 1 - 1 / the liquid's refractive index.
B is how ruffled the surface is with ripples too fine for the cells to
hold, which gather light in the same way and are for whoever draws it to
make up: 0 none, 1 as much as there can be, times `strength` and divided
by PT_WATER_RIPPLE_MAX. There are always a few, and more where waves are
or a stream runs.
A says whether there is liquid, there or in a cell next to it, and how
high it has lately stood, which is how far up its banks are wet.
foam: R is how much of the cell froth covers. G is how old it is, 0 just
made to 1. B and A are how fast the liquid under it is moving in x and y:
units per second + 128, from 1 to 255.
