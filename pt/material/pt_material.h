Makes, from nothing but the colours of a texture, what a path tracer wants
to know about the surface and old game art never recorded: which way its
small details face, how rough it is from place to place, and which of it is
metal.

The art it is meant for was painted by hand in a few hundred colours, with
its own light in it: raised edges were given a highlight on the side towards
the top left of the picture and a shadow on the other. That painted light is
the best evidence of shape there is, so it is read back as shape. Where
nothing was painted, dark is taken to be deep. Once the shape is known the
painted light is no longer wanted in the colours, where it would light every
raised edge a second time and from the wrong side as often as not, so the
picture can be had back with it taken out.

Metal is told by colour. Steel was painted grey and what covers or is not
metal vivid: rust, paint, wood, cloth, skin. And it was painted as dark as it
looks, not as bright as it reflects, so what a metal of a given painted
colour reflects is worked out here too.

It knows nothing about any game or renderer, and reads and writes no files.

What a metal reflects, worked out from the colour it was painted. Art made
to be looked at gives steel the dark grey it shows in a dim room, a small
part of what steel reflects, and a metal that reflected no more than that
would be black. rgb and out are linear light, 0 - 1, and may be the same.

level is what a metal painted PT_MATERIAL_METAL_PAINTED bright is taken to
reflect. One painted brighter reflects more, by the square root, which
halves the painting's contrast, and none reflects less than it was painted.
The hue is kept, but the more a colour is brightened the less is made of
it, or a dark brown would come out orange; of what is next to black no hue
is known. 0 or less leaves the colour as it is.

How bright is right depends on the rest of the picture. Steel reflects half
the light and more, but a level of 0.5 is for art whose other colours are
what those things reflect. Old game art is far darker than that all over,
and lit to match: beside it such a metal is a sheet of white.

A path tracer does this where it shades, not to the picture: what a surface
emits and what it scatters where it is not metal go by the colour as painted.
